    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Start by making the meat sauce. In a pan, heat some oil and sauté chopped onion and garlic until soft. Add minced meat (beef or a beef–pork mix) and cook until browned. Stir in tomato sauce (or crushed tomatoes), a bit of tomato paste, salt, pepper, and Italian herbs like oregano and basil. Let it simmer for about 15–20 minutes so the flavors deepen. In a separate bowl, mix ricotta cheese (or a thick white sauce), a little salt, pepper, and optionally an egg and some grated cheese. Boil lasagna sheets if they are not oven-ready.</p>

    <p>To assemble, spread a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a baking dish. Add a layer of lasagna sheets, then ricotta mixture, then meat sauce, and sprinkle mozzarella or grated cheese. Repeat the layers (usually 3 times). Finish with meat sauce and a generous cheese layer on top. Cover with foil and bake at about 180°C for 25–30 minutes, then uncover and bake 10 more minutes until golden and bubbly. Let it rest 10–15 minutes before cutting so it holds its shape.</p>
